This is an application that simulates your Neighborhood Library. 
The library is a free service to anyone in your neighborhood and is basedon the honor system. 
Anyone can check out a book, they just enter their name and the application will track who checked it out.

One interesting piece of code is:
```java
@Override
public String toString() {
    return "ID: " + id + ", ISBN: " + isbn + ", Title: " + title;
    }
```
this allowed me to print the actual titles of the books instead of their address in memory.
